To run the project on your local machines you need to install all the requirements from requirement.txt file. Obviously you need to have
python installed on your computer to install the packages

There are certain packages like dlib which are not officially available for the python versions above 3.6. If you are not able to 
install that due to new version there are various unofficial versions available on internet. I only need to install dlib from unofficial 
sources. I am mentioning the link for the github repo from where I installed dlib. I found it on stackoverflow.


The Project contains 3 folders :
1. flask app
2. html files used in flask webapp
3. pyhton codes used in building model.

## THE MAIN WEBAPP USING FLASK FRAMEWORK IS IN THE FLASK APP FOLDER. IF DUE TO SOME REASON YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO RUN FLASK WEBAPP THEN IN
THAT CASE I HAVE PROVIDED A HTML FILE FOLDER WHICH WILL BE ABLE TO RUN ALL OF MY FUNCTIONALITY EXCEPT THE ONE WHICH I HAVE MADE FROM 
PYTHON CODE.


### HOW TO RUN THE FLASK WEBAPP ###
STEPS :
1. Open the flask app folder in the visual studio code and then install requirements using pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Then through the vs code navigate to app folder inside the flask app folder (root folder). Inside the app folder open main.py and
   run that file.
